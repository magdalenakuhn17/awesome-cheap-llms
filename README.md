:point_right: Let’s make sure that your LLM application doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket.

# Tools & frameworks to reduce costs

## 1) Model family and type 
Selecting a suitable model or combination of models builds the foundation of building const-sensible LLM applications.

### In-depth papers that explain underlying concepts

* Large Language Model (LLM) Surveys
LLMs are evolving at a rapid speed making it hard to keep a good overview. The following paper fill that gap and provide a nice overview of the recent developments and compare the different LLMs.
1) Naveed, Humza, et al. ["A comprehensive overview of large language models."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06435?utm) arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.06435 (2023).
2) Minaee, Shervin, et al. ["Large Language Models: A Survey."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06196) arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.06196 (2024).

## 2) Model size 
After chosing the suitable model family, you should consider models with fewer parameters and other techniques that reduce model size.
* Selection of model parameter size 
* Quantization of models
* Through a higher degree of model customization, you can try to achieve the same performance as with a bigger model, i.e. through using RAG or fine-tuning.

* Distillation is technique that reduces the model size but is quite compute-intensive
* Model quantization

## 3) Open source vs. proprietary models
Consider self-hosting models instead of using proprietary models if you have capable developers in house. Still, have an oversight of Total Cost of Ownership, when benchmarking managed LLMs vs. setting up everything on your own.

## 4) Input/Output tokens
A key cost driver is the amount of input token (user prompt + context) and output token you allow for your LLM. Different techniques to reduce the amount of tokens help in saving costs.
* Compression
* Summarization

## 5) Prompt and model routing 
Add automatic checks to route all incoming user prompts to a suitable model. Follow Least-Model-Principle, which means to by default use the simplest possible logic or LM to answer a users question and only route to more complex LMs if necessary (aka. "LLM Cascading"). This can result to answering certain questions with a predefined response, using SLMs for simple questions and LLMs for complex questions. 

### Tools & frameworks that help with routing
* Native implementation in Python of your custom logic 
* **Nemo guardrails** to detect and Route based on intent

## 6) Caching 
If your users tend to send very similar prompts to your LLM system, you can reduce costs by using different cachin techniques:

## 7) Rate limiting 
Make sure one single customer is not able to penetrate your LLM and skyrocket your bill. Track amount of prompts per month per user and either hard limit to max amount of prompts or reduce response time when a user is hitting the limit. In addition, detect unnatural/sudden spikes in user requests (similar to DDOS attacks, users/competitors can harm your business by sending tons of requests to your model).
### Tools & frameworks that help with rate limiting:
* Simple tracking logic can be implemented in native Python

## 8) Cost tracking  
"You can't improve what you don't measure" --> Make sure to know where your costs are coming from. Is it super active users? Is it a premium model? etc.

## 9) During development time 
* Make sure to not send endless API calls to your LLM during development and manual testing.
* Make sure to not send automated API calls to your LLM via automated CICD workflows, integration tests etc.
